Description: Methods for estimation of multivariate average hazard ratios as
    defined by Kalbfleisch and Prentice. The underlying survival functions of the
    event of interest in each group can be estimated using either the (weighted)
    Kaplan-Meier estimator or the Aalen-Johansen estimator for the transition
    probabilities in Markov multi-state models. Right-censored and left-truncated
    data is supported. Moreover, the difference in restricted mean survival can be
    estimated.
